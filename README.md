# Pomodoro Timer

The Pomodoro Timer is a simple web app that helps you stay focused and productive while studying or working. It allows you to set a custom timer for your work sessions and breaks, with audio alerts to notify you when your time is up. The app is built using React, Tailwind and HTML.

## Features
* Set custom work and break times
* Audio alerts when time is up
* Dark and light mode
* Simple and easy to use

## Installation
To run the Pomodoro Timer locally, you'll need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. Once you have these installed, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone
2. Navigate to the project directory using the command line
3. Install the required dependencies by running npm install
4. Start the development server by running npm start
5. Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000/ to see the app running

## Usage
To use the Pomodoro Timer, simply open the app in your web browser and follow these steps:

1. Set the work time and break time using the up and down arrows next to the timer
2. Click the "Start" button to begin the timer
3. When the timer reaches 0, an audio alert will play to notify you that it's time for a break or to start working again
4. Click the "Reset" button to reset the timer to its default settings

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Contributing
